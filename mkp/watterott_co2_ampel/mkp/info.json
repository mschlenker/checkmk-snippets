{"author": "Mattias Schlenker <mattias.schlenker@tribe29.com>", "description": "Background: The Watterott CO2 Ampel (\"CO2 traffic light\") is a networkble sensor board, primarily made for monitoring CO2, but includes other sensors as temperature and humidity as well. It is open hardware and uses an open source firmware. https:\/\/learn.watterott.com\/breakouts\/co2-ampel\/ \n\nThe factory firmware includes a simple Checkmk agent via HTTP\/REST-API: http:\/\/12.34.56.78\/cmk-agent\n\nSince the agent is only available via HTTP, the monitoring has to be configured using \"individual program call instead of agent access\", see\n\nhttps:\/\/docs.checkmk.com\/latest\/en\/datasource_programs.html\n\nThe output includes one local check that creates a service immediately after discovery. However this takes thresholds from the EPROM of the boards which makes central administration difficult. This plugin adds discovery for all other sensors. Since different versions of the board have differect sensors, individual discovery is needed.\n\nGerman users: See ASR3.5 and ASR3.6 (Germany) for thresholds on CO2\/temperature\/humidity in working environments. Only CO2 is quite fixed at 1000ppm. If no quick exchange of air is possible, lower thresholds from 1000\/1200 to 900\/1000.\n", "download_url": "https:\/\/github.com\/mschlenker\/checkmk-snippets\/", "files": {"agent_based": ["co2welectronic.py"], "web": ["plugins\/wato\/co2welectronic_parameters.py"]}, "name": "watterott_CO2_ampel", "title": "Watterott CO2 Ampel", "version": "0.1.2", "version.min_required": "2.1.0", "version.packaged": "2.1.0p12", "version.usable_until": "2.2.999"}
